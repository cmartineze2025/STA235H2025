Walk to Sunday Brunch, dinner or drinks in the Founders Bar and come home, close the door and feel like it is miles from anywhere.  Open this beautiful haven to friends and family for the perfect entertaining sphere where guests can spill from the spacious interior to a backyard oasis with one of the most picturesque pools in Austin.  
            Built originally as a model home, it's hard to wish for a feature that isn't here. The dramatic centerpiece inside is the sweeping scrolled iron stairway rising between the entry and the two story living area.  Two tiers of windows curve as a wall of glass looking out onto the incredible back patio, pool and yard, facing east which brings morning light and protection from the sun in the evenings...a perfect Texas hill country setting. The covered patio is ready for year round use, with a mister system for warmer days and a fireplace and roll down clear awnings for our treasured, lovely winter nights.  The music system that runs throughout the house provides background melodies for al fresco dinners, swimming and relaxation.
            Indoors, the core for cooking and entertaining is a fully appointed kitchen with spreading granite-clad  work spaces and professional quality appliances including a stainless six-burner gas stove and suspended vent hood built into a stone alcove.  Double ovens and warming drawer are encased in rich stained cabinetry custom built to include pull-out shelving throughout, wine glass storage, a massive island with 12 drawers and a huge pantry...the perfect venue for culinary ventures.
            Also on the main floor, a guest room and bath, the study and a large laundry area accompany the lovely high-ceiling master with views to the perfectly manicured and private back yard.  Escape from frantic days with a long, luxurious soak in the deep corner tub or let stress wash away in the large mosaic tile and glass shower under a bronze rainwater showerhead.
             A second living area or game room upstairs is equipped with a wet bar and wine refrigerator and is flanked by three bedrooms with accompanying baths.  The magic happens a couple of steps down into a fantastic media room with a 1080P 3-D projector and a 7.1 surround sound system. 
            Thirty discretely placed solar panels prove this home to be smart as well as gorgeous.  The pool equipment, garage doors, solar electric system, irrigation system and selected lights can be accessed from a smart phone via apps.

"78757","The complete remodel of this 1948 Brentwood split-bedroom home retains all the charm of the era with all the wow of now. Starting with the immaculate landscaping, new roof and driveway, this home has serious curb appeal! Visitors will be able to spot your home as the standout of the street with sparkling-white siding and five-panel mahogany door with modern glass accents, and they'll probably comment on the stylishly oversized, rustic planter boxes and all-new native Texas landscaping as well. 

The light and energy created by the 14ft vaulted ceiling in the living room is the result of a foundation-to-roof beam renovation that included stylish architectural upgrades. You wouldn't settle for anything less than the 6” White Oak plank flooring throughout this home which, together with stark-white walls, creates a clean look that's spacious and bright. Paired with dark accents like the modern ceiling fan in the living room and airy, black metal bannister that leads upstairs, and you have a clean, modern home that's ready for any style of decor, and the open floor plan downstairs will accommodate any size and configuration of living and dining decor. 

This brand-new kitchen design includes all-new stainless appliances, custom cabinets, white quartz countertops, and a clean, contemporary, textured white tile backsplash. The large window over the sink and glass globe light fixtures over the kitchen island create light and space in this area, and the island has additional bar seating. 

Floor-to-ceiling cabinets flank the refrigerator nook, giving additional storage. The highlight of this space is the oversized sliding-glass door that opens onto the patio, connecting living, dining and outdoor spaces seamlessly for entertaining. 

The large laundry room has the same beautiful sea blue custom cabinets and quartz countertops as the kitchen, giving you additional storage and workspace. Right off the laundry and kitchen is a lovely guest bedroom or office that opens up right into the backyard via a sliding glass door. 

The three-quarter bath has a spacious shower with clean, white subway tile and a built-in storage nook. The custom cabinets, black fixtures and the matte-black honeycomb tile perfectly reflect the clean color palette of the living area. Along with the other conveniences of this split-bedroom plan is a downstairs master. It's bright with windows and views of the surrounding trees, as well as a sleek black ceiling fan for year-round comfort. 

The master bath looks straight out of a boutique hotel, with glass globe light fixtures and black framed pivoting wall mirrors mounted on white shiplap. The quartz countertops and black honeycomb tile complete the space, but our favorite feature has to be this master shower! The square, tiled shower is tiled with matte white subway tile that gives it a subtle, sleek texture. Two storage nooks are accented with grey penny tile, but the absolute best feature is the high, rectangular window that gives you additional light and space while preserving privacy. And of course this renovation includes a must-have walk-in closet! The closet features the same 6” White Oak floors as the rest of the house with luxurious built-ins to maximize space and keep everything organized. 

Two more bedrooms and a full bath upstairs make this house private and accommodating. The third bathroom features a stark white vanity with quartz top, dark grey slate tile, and a bathtub/shower combo featuring vertical slate tile with a contemporary glass tile accent and stainless-steel fixtures. 

In addition to all the amazing upgrades, this home is also close to the booming North Burnet Corridor, as well as the nearby top-rated public schools, Brentwood Elementary and Lamar Middle School.

"78729","Imagine coming home every day to this beautiful, updated home and its lush corner lot shaded with mature oak trees. Located in the sought after Milwood neighborhood, the home's prime location means you can enjoy your tranquil retreat, but still be only 10 minutes from some of the best shopping and dining Austin has to offer. As you step through the front door, you're greeted with the lodge-like soaring ceilings, cozy fireplace and rich wood tones of the living area. The unique, open floor plan flows from the living room into the kitchen and dining areas, so you have ample space for family and guests, but can still stay visually connected. Three bedrooms and two and a half bathrooms give you enough flexibility to accommodate a growing family or to have a home office or workout room. The second floor is entirely dedicated to a secluded, private, peaceful master suite - a place to recharge and refresh away from the hustle and bustle of the rest of the world. The master suite includes a generous bedroom, and two roomy closets. The master bathroom has features dual vanities and plenty of room for two to get ready for work - or a night out - at the same time. The large corner lot is shaded by mature trees which ensure privacy and verdant, restful vistas. The expansive backyard is surrounded by a new privacy fence, making it ideal for children and pets as well as outdoor entertaining on the patio. Energy efficient double-pane windows help keep you comfy and bills down in both the heat of summer and the chilliest days of winter. The location is one of the best features of all. The home is only about 10 minutes from high end shops and restaurants at the Domain - including Whole Foods Market, Apple Store, Nordstrom, Dillards, and more, and less than 15 minutes from Lakeline Mall with its more than 150 stores and restaurants. With easy access to 183 and Mopac, you're less than 30 minutes from the vibrant nightlife of downtown Austin and convenient to many popular destinations. Closer to home, it's a 10-minute walk to the top-rated Jollyville Elementary school and even closer to the residents-only Rattan Creek Park, which offers tennis courts, a junior olympic size swimming pool, sandlot volleyball courts, walking trails, picnic areas with bbq pits, and a community center.

"78705","Sumptuous finishes define this home. It's everything you need and nothing you don't.  With its idyllic location in the Aldridge Place Historic District, this unique and rare Spanish Revival bungalow was designed and built in 1928 by distinguished architect Hugo Kuehne.  Kuehne, founder of the University of Texas School of Architecture, who was responsible for such noted works as the Austin History Center, the Commodore Perry Hotel, and the Ritz Theater.    The sellers purchased the home in 2011 and undertook a very extensive restoration and remodel throughout 2012/2013.  The project was designed by architect Ann Tucker of Studio A Group and built by Garland Turner of Woodeye Construction, with the goal of returning the home to its former glory. Unfortunately, there wasn't much left to work with when the owners took possession in 2011; doors and mantles had been removed, windows were oddly placed, and bathrooms had been cheaply redone. Despite these setbacks, the home has always remained a neighborhood favorite. The current owners took a lot of time and thought to make decisions to recreate a timeless home that will live on for the next 100 years.     The extensive, 10 month remodel included all new electrical, plumbing, roof, HVAC ductwork and returns, major foundation and leveling work, subfloors, fully-insulated walls/ceilings, level 5 wall finish, custom millwork, kitchen, baths, lighting, steel doors, windows, fireplace and chimney, flooring, and built-ins.    The home is located in one of the most walkable parts of town. The University of Texas, Blanton Museum of Art, Central Market, Wheatsville Coop, great restaurants including Texas French Bread, El Patio, Via 313, Black's BBQ, Hopfields, Thai Kitchen, Counter Cafe, Sip Pho all are within a few minutes walk.

"78703","This mid-century modern home was featured in a 1968 Architectural Digest publication presenting award-winning architecture by R. Gommel Roessner. Located in Pemberton Heights, the residence sits quietly tucked, surrounded by a plethora of beautiful tree foliage.  Rare 20-ft redwood planks, tinted glass, handmade brick and copper material blend together to create an atmosphere combining features from the exterior and interior. Roessner's prized talent best illustrated in this property, was his ability to create spaces that preserved privacy while maintaining an openness in plan. Roessner, recognized by the Texas Society of Architects for excellence in design, received a Merit Award from the AIA for his work at 7 Green Lanes.Three living, three fireplaces, two dining, two wet bars, a fully-equipped kitchen, intercom system and an impressive second floor game room are accessible by stairways on either end of the home. Every room flows appealingly onto one or more balconies, terraces or gardens as part of their own outdoor living space. The intimate foyer draws into a dramatic living with its 18-foot ceiling, two-story windows and brick fireplace. In the breakfast, one will find a second high-ceiling assembly space with courtyard exposure through two-story glass. In twenty ten to twenty eleven, this wall was replaced with new steel and tempered glass. Bubbling water features, garden sculptures, a children?s playground and palms set the stage for its extraordinary setting within the closure of a garden wall. The kitchen features two islands, new sink features, a compactor, gas stove, oven, two refrigerators and walk-in pantry. Access to the two-car garage, more storage and a large utility room with washer and dryer complete the main level. From private balconies on one side to tall windows on the other, each large bedroom offers scenic views from every angle. A double-sided vanity, three closets, newer doors and toilet, and a walk-in shower complete the re-tiled master bath. Additional updates consist of several new windows, including new thermal windows on the South wall, TPO roofing, cable and surround sound wiring.

"78705","This five-bed, four-and-a-half bath, historic Austin home blends the elegance of yesterday with the style of tomorrow-- a unique meeting of enduring design and modern luxury. The original structure was built in the early 1900s, with recent additions being made by the world-renown Paul Streeter and his team at Camelot Custom Homes. 
The Mediterranean marvel sits on the corner lot of the city’s widest street, the sidewalks lined with a mix of oak and pecan trees. The wrap-around porch looks out over established landscaping and a lush green yard. The stucco exterior and custom carvings on the outside of the home are a masterful blend of Mediterranean flare and Texas taste. 
The entryway draws all eyes to the marble-tiled fireplace holding court at the front of the great room. Natural light pours through the oversized windows, flowing across the great room and into the formal dining area. Stucco arches lead into the gourmet kitchen, equipped with an immaculate island, breakfast bar, and ample counterspace alongside Bosch appliances and a Thermador gas range.
The well-appointed kitchen is flanked on one side by a second living area, and on the other by a casual dining space with vaulted ceilings and raised windows which garner even more natural light. The downstairs study impresses with floor-to-ceiling, built-in shelves and private French doors leading to the porch. 
Each of the three spacious downstairs bedrooms has its own en-suite bath, with the master suite offering both a shower and a Duravit soaking tub. A flex room near the back of the house provides the option for a second study or a fourth downstairs bedroom with private access, via French doors, to an additional yard space. A bathroom could easily be added to this room.
The hallway hosts a double set of French doors opening to a private courtyard area with rock and stone landscaping, outdoor plants, and another tract of green grass. 
An over-sized laundry room includes a sink station and cabinets galore, while the upstairs space opens into a multi-level game and entertainment room, two more bedrooms, and full bath.  If desired, the second floor is already perfectly designed to serve as an income producing rental property.  A three-car garage rounds out this remarkable home, which also includes a tax-saving designation as an Austin Historic Landmark.
Just beyond the low-set stone walls of the property, within easy walking distance, is first-class shopping and dining along the Guadalupe corridor, including Wheatsville Grocery Coop, Torchy’s Tacos and Amy’s Ice Cream.  Only two miles north of downtown, this prime location offers the easiest of access to all the best of Austin

I almost didn't buy this house because of the smaller square footage, but was impressed -- it seems and feels way bigger!  

Stunning central re-model, with many custom upgrades. All new living spaces, including all applicances!

This totally unique and rustic-modern home was professionally designed and remodelled by HGTV and their team of contractors and designers less than a year ago - everything is new: washer/dryer, fridge, stove. custom tilework, full kitchen and bathroom.

Bedrooms are close to equal in size, with two larger and one slightly-smaller ""office"" room (could still easily fit a king bed). 

All bedrooms have closets, no walk-ins, though. Two larger bedrooms have 2 windows each.

As a bonus, there's a massive 500 sq ft building on property for conversion to 2nd rental until! Use this extra buliding as a workshop, second rental house, storage, etc! Has perfect foundation, windows, 3 doors, great roof and solid walls. 
 
Tree-lined neighborhood is very quiet but close enough to downtown, and simply wonderful neighbors!

"78732","Austin's coveted Steiner Ranch is an ideal hub for active family life and this home is a perfect base from which that community involvement can grow.  The stone and stucco, master down home on a spreading corner site is remarkably private, beautiful and has wonderful spots both inside and out for families to gather or to break away to their own individual corners of the world
            Iron handrails on the stairway sweep up in a two story entry flanked by the formal dining and a study with extraordinary, stained beadboard shelving and custom cabinetry.  Both rooms have plantation shutters that allow light to highlight the rooms that flow into the entry lit with clerestory windows, lighting the wide path to the family room beyond. 
            The kitchen, family and breakfast room are open to each other and windows lead along the back wall to the very private back yard.  In the two-story family room, a cast stone mantel surrounds a gas log fireplace and stained built-ins provide storage and space for a giant television screen.  
            Lots of prep space on granite counters over richly stained cabinets  in a large kitchen will inspire cooking by a lone chef or a collaborative group of creative cooks enjoying the assembly of snacks or meals for friends and family gathered in the family room or outside on the covered patio.
            On a beautiful day or a cool Texas evening, a few steps outside yields an outdoor treasure.  An inviting stone pavilion/kitchen sits shaded by trees with a built-in barbecue pit, refrigerator and a rock fireplace that will transform a winter night into a mini holiday.  Wired for music and cooled by a ceiling fan hanging from the stained wood ceiling, this escape will beckon those who need that outdoor respite from a busy day.
            Upstairs, one bedroom has its own bathroom and the other two bedrooms share a jack and jill bath.  A large media room or game room serves as a separate living area for informal movies or games away from the main floor.
            The master bedroom on the main floor allows for a retreat from the rest of the home while everyone is involved in activities of their own.  A deep corner tub is an invitation to get away.  Separate vanities, a glass shower and large closet spaces are perfectly scaled for comfort and living peacefully.
            This home has space for everyone, either together for relaxing and celebrating or shaking off the day in private rooms of their own.

"78750","Thanks for looking! The house is now under contract. If you would still like to view the house by appt. please call me. I have canceled the open house. 
The current asking price represents good value for a great family home in great move-in shape, in which everything works. I will forego further painting (kitchen), replacing the carpeting and kitchen appliances. These are personal cosmetic choices for the new owner to make, if desired. This is a special house with a lot of extras and features not found in other homes in Lakewood. This home is on one of the largest lots in Lakewood and is one of the only Lakewood homes with an in-ground pool and spa. The pool and spa were recently re-tiled and re-plastered. There is a large attic over the garage and a very effective whole house fan in the garage. There are ceiling fans throughout the house. There are 2 independent environmental control areas for heating and cooling. The living room area AC/Heating complete system was recently replaced with high efficiency systems less than 2 yrs ago. The bedroom side AC/Heating (complete system) is being replaced and is brand new. 
I updated and improved much of the house while I’ve lived here. I installed granite countertops, new sinks, and new fixtures throughout. I removed all wallpaper, resurfaced, and painted the walls. A new, 30 year roof was added in 2005. All pool equipment (pumps, DE filter, pool heater) was replaced, and new water heater, new garage doors and openers were added recently.  I have kept my home well-maintained and in good repair. I have receipts and documentation for all additions, repairs, renovations. Most of the house was painted recently, including the garage and garage cabinets. The carpet is in good condition. The new owner may continue additional updating to enhance the value further and make it their own. 
Please contact through Zillow by email or leave message at 512-241-1660. I will show the house to prospective buyers by appointment or come by for the open house on Jan. 13.

"78703","A sense of history, coupled with a love of design, defines the spirit of Keith House, a designated historical sight in Austin's venerated and coveted Pemberton Heights neighborhood. A long, wide covered front porch leads to a modern glass and metal front door and a bronze medallion forever marking this home as an important part of Austin's architectural history.  Designed originally in 1933 for the sister of noted architect, William D. Anderson, the home was built on this site to take advantage of the Capitol view. Although the view is long since blocked by growth and progress, its proximity to the urban energy of Austin's city center remains a particular asset in this prime location.
            
            Once inside the gates that surround the property, graceful landscaping shaded by huge, mature oaks provides a secluded stage for dinners or drinks under a covered pergola that seats 12, with brick walls on 3 sides and a fireplace at one end. This outdoor haven, wired for music, invites both grand and intimate gatherings under the canopy of trees.
            
            Immaculate, sunlit rooms inside are spacious, comfortable and inviting.  Rich, stained wood floors throughout the house anchor rooms with carefully crafted moldings, cased openings and bookcases harkening back in time and painted in tones of ivory and white to keep the atmosphere light and modern.  Two large living areas on the first floor provide space for entertaining or peaceful relaxation.  Window coverings of shades or plantation shutters have been professionally selected and perfectly complete each room.
            
            The kitchen has been expanded from the original design, with brilliant white glass-front cabinets and ivory, white and gray granite counters.  A gas, six-burner commercial style stove sits below a custom vent hood.  A farmhouse double pulley pendant marries old and new while lighting the work space of a large island flanked by a built-in refrigerator and a separate wine fridge.
            
            A small office retreat off the kitchen is as inviting as the larger rooms with glass doors leading to the outside.              
            
            In the entry, a winding staircase makes for a sweeping and lovely route upstairs toward two spacious bedrooms, both with doors that open to balconies.  The master bath is filled with light and features white marble counters, a claw foot tub, a separate glass shower and marble baseboards.  The second bedroom works as another master adjoining its own spacious bath with black and white basketweave tile floors and soft green trim.
            
            Taking ownership of this home fulfills a love of architecture and an attachment to our now bustling city.  Austin may have expanded and grown up around this magnificent piece of history, but Keith House has been designed and updated to maintain a private, gated garden setting that defies time and lets progress sweep by while providing a stately, peaceful and comfortable retreat from this very, very busy city.",1,"FALSE","TRUE","FALSE","FALSE",1933,999,"7",2019,22,"0",2,2,0,1,0,0,0,10454,3018,1.13333333333333,7,1298,16,3,2,2,"11777"
