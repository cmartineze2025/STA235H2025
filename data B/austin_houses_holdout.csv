Neighborhood Description

Clarksville has the best of both worlds: It's a quaint, quiet Austin neighborhood with unique homes, diverse residents, and plenty of history, but it's in the center of the city and only a stone's throw from downtown's many attractions. Clarksville is far from suburbia; it's an eclectic urban hub in the heart of the city so it attracts people who love to be in the mix of things. It's a hip area and is home base for much of the city's creative crowd (there are many art galleries in Clarksville). If you enjoy walking, you will love strolling through Clarksville's hilly streets. Clarksville Park and West Austin Park are two small parks in the neighborhood, and each contain wading pools that are open in the summer.

Neighborhood Description

From the neighborhood association at http://rosedale-na.org/ 

""The majority of the homes in the Rosedale area were built during the 1930s and 1940s, giving them an allure not found with newer construction. The many renovation projects and new construction throughout the neighborhood lend a sense of vitality and renewal. The population of the neighborhood is a fabulous blend of young families, single professionals, and original owners who raised their children here and have many tales to tell.

Beyond the delightful charm of the area, the Rosedale neighborhood's location makes it one of the most desirable of Austin's neighborhoods. We have close proximity to the Capitol, the downtown area, and the University of Texas at Austin, as well as easy access to the main thoroughfares of our beautiful city.""

Quartz countertops, brand new stainless steel appliances, designer tile, and more. Hate mowing the yard? We have you covered. Superb, easy to maintain (xeriscaped with native plants), no grass landscaping. I could go on, but the pictures already show how immaculate and beautiful this home is inside and out.

If you haven't already fallen in love with the house, you will fall in love with the location. 3 minutes to get on 183, 5 minutes to get on I-35 and Mopac, 5 minutes to the Domain or Anderson Alamo Drafthouse, 10 minutes to downtown, 3 minutes to more breweries than I can count, 3 minutes to the amazing Mexican food on Lamar/HEB, and ladies, you are .7 miles away from Target (my wife thought that was important to mention haha).

To make the deal even better, we are offering the home fully furnished! 

Due to COVID, we are not offering tours at this time. However, for the tenants that are selected to occupy the home, we will do a walkthrough and be happy to remove any pieces of furniture you do not want/need.

Brand new Samsung washer/dryer convey
$750 Security Deposit 
$350 Pet Deposit (would prefer no cats, as my wife is allergic, if want property furnished)

PLEASE EMAIL FOR ALL INQUIRIES
 In your email include your FULL NAME and EMAIL ADDRESS. I will send applications to those who request them. 

Looking for tenants with good credit/rental history and who will treat the home as their own. We use a rental property software called Avail, so applicants will apply via the Avail link. Only one person who will occupy the house needs to complete the application. This person should be the one who will pay the rent.

Tenants will be reviewed in the order in which they complete the application. Once I have an amazing tenant, I will inform all others who have been sent an application to not apply (the fee associated with applying does not go to me, and I don't want people to waste their money).

NO Smokers - We likely will move back into this house in the future and do not want the walls/furniture to smell like smoke.
Move-in date is flexible. September 1st would be absolute earliest, but can be flexible within a few weeks.
Must be ok paying for rent via Avail website (set up ACH auto draft or manually draft each month)

All of this with an Austin address but not annexed into the city and an amazing current tax rate of under 1.92%.

This stunning modern estate, known as “Acqua Villa”, resides on the shores of Lake Travis, off the deepest portion of the lake. Private and gated, the property features a tri-level 8,800 sq ft estate, including separate guest house, adjustable boat dock, 6-car garage, and infinity edge pool with dual hot tubs. Take in phenomenal panoramic views up and down the lake from the pool and sprawling travertine sun deck.
Designed by award-winning architect Winn Wittman, Acqua Villa is a visually sweeping tour-de-force of luxury, green technology, and modern aesthetics, while being featured on the Discovery Channel and in design magazines such as Objekt. The home merges naturally with the beauty of Lake Travis, with floor-to-ceiling windows lining the home providing natural light and opening up to the lake. As one approaches the home, the driveway becomes a breeze-way, framing a spectacular vista of Lake Travis.

Through stainless entry doors, one comes to a large living area with soaring ceilings crowned with Zeppelin chandeliers. Fiber optic lighting installations and mechanical sun shades are controlled by the touch of an iPad. A gourmet kitchen with caesarstone worktops and floors, stainless appliances, and bar, open up to the living area. Upstairs, the spacious master suite features walk-in closet, balcony overlooking water, and master bath with oversized jetted tub, steam shower, and dual vanities. All three levels of the villa are also accessible by elevator.

Acqua Villa is also engineered for entertaining, relaxing, and ultimate recreation. The lake is just out the back door, with adjustable boat dock and slip capable of accommodating 42' boat. Two jet-ski ramps and further deck space allow for further access of the lake. The sprawling sun deck and infinity edge pool are also complimented by pool house with kitchenette and cryotherapy spa. The pool itself is flanked by small manicured lawns fenced off by glass, unencumbering the lake views. Separate guest quarters offer full bath, along with kitchenette. Among the 5 living areas in the home is a state-of-the-art theater room.

Private and secure, Acqua Villa has 10 iPad-controlled surveillance cameras, and secured, gated entry. Just 25 minutes to Downtown Austin, and within minutes of Lake Travis area shopping and The Oasis.

One of the best features of this home is the bonus room upstairs!  It is a large, approximately 18’ x 15’ room with lots of windows and a full bathroom.  The bathroom matches the motif of the rest of the home with polished Marble counters, maple-like cabinets and ceramic tile.  This room is perfect for a 4th bedroom, office, game room or man cave!
